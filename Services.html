    <h1>Video-Editing</h1>
    <p>With years of experience, ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual is able to 
    craft a highly professional end-product; no matter whether it is a commercial, social media video, digital out of home 
    advertisement, content for the web, a presentation, live registration, event or a full feature-film for the silver screen. Anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="audiopost">
    <h1>Audio-Post</h1>
    <p>Video is only half the picture. A powerful audio mix is just as important if you want to convey your message to the public. 
    ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual offers numerous possibilities in the audio department. Whether you want an audiomix for broadcasting purposes, 
    a great sounding podcast, or a webmix for any type of content, including short films, we will be able to provide you with what you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="mograph">
    <h1>Motion Graphics</h1>
    <p>Motion Graphics can inspire, guide, instruct, activate or evoke a response from your viewer. For instance, they can be used as 
    complimentary assets for a video to enhance its overall style, or highlight a specific product that is being advertised. 
    Motion Graphics are highly effective in breaking down complex matters in a digestable and memorable manner. </p>
</div>
<div class="subtitle">
    <h1>Subtitling</h1>
    <p>Did you know that subtitling is not only used for television and cinema, but also highly requested in social media content 
    for Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn? Considering that the audio on most social media platforms is off by default for video content 
    on autoplay, subtitles can be used to convey your message to the viewer, even without audio and any effort required from the viewer. 
    It also works great for other purposes where audio is often switched off by default, such as corporate narrowcasting. 
    If desired, ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual is able to assist you with the translation from Dutch to English and vice versa!</p>
</div>
<div class="animation">
    <h1>Animation</h1>
    <p>Do you have a product that you wish to bring under people’s attention? 
    Is there some kind of service, process, idea, or opinion you want to have heard, but don’t know how? Try animation! 
    It is an highly effective way to keep the attention of your viewers and turn them into potential followers, buyers or fans.</p>
</div>
<div class="delivery">
    <h1>Delivery</h1>
    <p>Yes, delivery for any screen and purpose. No matter if it is played on a smartphone, tablet, cinema projector, television, web, 
    narrowcasting screen, art installation, a custom built art installation, or on one of those massive digital out of home screens next to the 
    highway. Just send a e-mail for the possibilities!</p>
</div>
<div class="authoring">
    <h1>DVD/Blu-Ray Authoring</h1>
    <p>Physical media carriers are still used more often than you might initially think. What about a professionally crafted end product on a Blu-Ray disc for back-up purposes, or to present to 
    clients? Let ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual do the entire process for you. From designing highly professional full-motion DVD/Blu-ray menu’s 
    and DVD inlays, to the actual burning of the discs. ARCTIC LIME will be able to assist you with everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="digitization">
    <h1>Digitization/Upscaling</h1>
    <p>With technology improving rapidly on such a massive scale, many well-known analog media containers such as VHS and DV tapes are 
    becoming less and less common. Let ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual create digital copies of your memories. You’ll be able to play these back 
    on a lot of different electronic equipment, such as desktop and laptop computers, televisions, smartphones and tablets. 
    Just as with any other type of content you would like us to upscale, we are able to even professionally upscale the images in order 
    to fit modern day standards, and if desired, the files can be placed on a hard drive or USB stick. Depending on the original resolution 
    of the footage, we are able to enhance the footage to Full HD and even 4K resolutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="duplication">
    <h1>File duplication</h1>
    <p>Need your files duplicated on a second medium, such as a CD, DVD, Blu-ray, USB Stick, SD card or Hard Drive? ARCTIC LIME is happy to help.
       We can do it fast and secure. Send a e-mail for the possibilities!
    </p>
</div>
<div class="encoding">
    <h1>Encoding/Conversion</h1>
    <p>Do you want your audiofiles in a different format, or a video master file in several different formats or perhaps even in a JPG 
    sequence? No worries, ARCTIC LIME understands what you are looking for.</p>
