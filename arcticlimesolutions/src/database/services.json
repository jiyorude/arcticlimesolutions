    "description": "Broaden your global horizons!",
    "text": "Did you know that subtitling is not only used for television and cinema, but also highly requested in social media content for Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn? Considering that the audio on most social media platforms is off by default for video content on autoplay, subtitles can be used to convey your message to the viewer, even without audio and any effort required from the viewer. It also works great for other purposes where audio is often switched off by default, such as corporate narrowcasting. If desired, ARCTIC LIME Solutions is able to assist you with the translation."
