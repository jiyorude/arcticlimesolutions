      "ARENA is a visual study about Quake III Arena; its environments and its textures; and a deeper critical look at over two-hundred maps that many of us seemed to have spent many hours in; to fight, frag, strafe, score and humiliate. The map as a 'being' is the outside layer of an onion, serving as the aesthetic layer for all of the nail-biting and nerve-wrecking last-moment capture the flag scores and all of the digital bloodshed that takes place within this vast universe where only the strongest can prevail.",
      "ARENA is antimatter; rejecting skill and traditional means of gameplay. No power-ups, weapons and/or players are found. It is you, your inner thoughts and the arena, inside a world that is empty, inside a universe that is limitless. The rest is up to you.",
