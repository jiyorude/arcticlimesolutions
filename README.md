This branch contains the *legacy* code from the original ARCTIC LIME AudioVisual website and is no longer maintained.
The original website was built with HTML and CSS alone and was my first project I coded from scratch; thus containing a lot of redundant and repeated code.
Furthermore, the website was not properly optimized at all, but I decided to keep it for archival and nostalgic purpose.
